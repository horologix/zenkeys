That’s who we really are."},{"author":"Socrates - Fear of Death","text":"To fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise, without being wise: for it is to think that we know what we do not know. For anything that men can tell, death may be the greatest good that can happen to them: but they fear it as if they knew quite well that it was the greatest of evils. And what is this but that shameful ignorance of thinking that we know what we do not know?"},{"author":"River Song - Doctor Who, The Wedding of River Song","text":"You've touched so many lives, saved so many people.

Never give up your right to be wrong, because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life. Remember that fear always lurks behind perfectionism. Confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to be human can, paradoxically, make yourself a happier and more productive person."},{"author":"Albert Einstein","text":"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.

It resembles my own except that you happen to be insane."},{"author":"Joseph Kreigs - Wind Spirit","text":"Some of us don't think twice when we're given the opportunity to live free.

In reality there are only a handful of skilled players who can play his most complex pieces. It takes a lot of patience to learn and requires a fantastic memory."},{"author":"Oscar Wilde - Preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray","text":"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things. The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault."},{"author":"Rasha Terry - Beauty in Life","text":"The beauty in life is not always what you see. The beauty in life is hearing music so sweet, holding a child's hand, smelling the ocean and tasting the richest chocolates.

My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind... and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge."},{"author":"C.S Lewis - To love","text":"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable."},{"author":"Lucille Ball","text":"Luck?

Luck to me is something else: Hard work - and realizing what is opportunity and what isn't."},{"author":"John Keats, Bright Star","text":"A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not work the lake out; it is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and emboldens the soul to accept the mystery."},{"author":"Shrek","text":"It may be hard to believe, what, with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think I was a monster.

If you listened long enough you might begin to feel it in the chill of the window glass and the smooth plaster walls of the innkeeper's room.

And it was in the hands of the man who lay there, motionless, watching for the first pale hint of dawn's coming light."},{"author":"Nelson Mandela","text":"There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires."},{"author":"Steven Moffat - \"Blink\", Doctor Who","text":"They're coming.

But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. Don't hurt him, don't change him, and don't expect more than he can give. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he's not there.

In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle.

It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils; it is moreover the way to win the favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man. Yet the habit of passive acceptance is a disastrous one in later life. It causes man to seek and to accept a leader, and to accept as a leader whoever is established in that position."},{"author":"Oprah Winfrey","text":"My philosophy is that not only are you responsible for your life, but doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment."},{"author":"Old Spice - Choosing a Spokesperson","text":"Us being two white guys, it sounds like we're trying to be cool when we say we didn't notice it, but it didn't cross our minds.

It's Failure. That might be counter-intuitive but it's a fact, so obvious that we ignore it up to the point that we've forgotten its true meaning.

It is not quite so brittle and the people as a rule just wear clothes and drink drinks. There is more sense of background, as if Cheesecake Manor really existed all around and not just in the part the camera sees; there are more long walks over the downs and the characters don't all try to behave as if they had just been tested by MGM.
